# Learn React-Query with Dhruv Parmar
Hello Guys, I am **Dhruv Parmar**. Let's learn React Query together. If you like my content than plese give a **star** to this repository and also share with your friends.

## What is React Query ?
React query is a very efficient query caching client for the front-end which can replace traditional methods of fetching data on the mounting stage of the component and global state management like Redux in some use cases.

React Query gives us **caching of server data** out of the box with cache invalidation and request deduping.

## How do you handle errors in the React Query ?
There are mainly three ways to handle the errors in the React Query :
1) By using useQuery(): error property returned from useQuery().
2) onError callback
3) by using Error Boundaries
